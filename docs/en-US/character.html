					ARCHE PLUMFIELD
				</div>
				The protagonist of our story, Arche is a bright, energetic young girl. She holds dear the skills in
				swordsmanship her father taught her, and she carries a big (for her) sword wherever she goes.
				Aspiring to be like her father, who was once one of Scotsholm's most skilled swordsmen, she spends her
				days getting into little adventures - however, her honest-to-a-fault personalityand her tendency to not
				think things through gets her into no
				small amount of danger, as well. Even in the danger, her perpetually sunny disposition and incredible
				luck always see her through.

					STELLA MAYBERK
				</div>
				A classmate of Arche's at the Minasa-Ratis Magic School. The treasured daughter of one of Scotsholm's
				wealthiest families and heiress to one of its largest companies, a savant at magic, and arguably
				Minasa-Ratis' prettiest student.
				Despite her natural gifts and her seeming perfection in all she does, she's very cold to her fellow
				classmates and, as the game opens, has no real friends.
				Unbeknownst to everyone, she aspires to be just like her idol, the sage Minasa-Ratis herself, and Stella
				constantly pushes herself to ever greater - and harsher - heights to reach this goal... and her desire
				may be a result of an incident from her past.
				<br><br>
				She always wears a high-grade elemental stone on a bracelet, called Royal Scarlet; it and Stella are
				perfect for one another, and Stella can use it to cast incredibly powerful fire magic.

				A gentle and painfully shy student at Minasa-Ratis, and the first student Arche meets there. Her talent

				<br>
				Normally, she's a quiet, dedicated student, but after she meets Arche, she ends up dragged into
				increasingly incredible adventures.
