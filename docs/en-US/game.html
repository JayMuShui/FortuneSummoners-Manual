		Fortune Summoners is a real-time RPG in which your characters adventure together in a party.
		<br>
		<br>
		You will discover what you must do from your interactions with others in towns and other safe areas. Once you
		do, ensure you have what you need from the local shops, gather your party, and venture forth into the
		wilderness!<br>
