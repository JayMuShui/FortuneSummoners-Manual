		While individual moves are important in Fortune Summoners, the real core of the game is working with your party
		to overcome trials.
		<br>

		Full understanding of how to give the AI orders, controlling the camera, status effects, unblockable attacks and
		combos will give you an edge in battle.

		About Combos
	</div>
	<div class="c_block_body">
		<img class="c_screen" src="./images/battle/battle_combo.jpg" align="right" />
		If you land five or more hits on an enemy, the combo meter will display on the left-hand side of the screen,
		and if you continue the combo attack, the meter will continue to fill and you will deal more damage to an enemy.
		At 50% you deal 1.5 times normal damage; by 200%, the maximum, your damage is tripled.
		<br>
		<br>
		If there are multiple foes on screen, hitting any of them will extend the combo. Attacks from all your allies
		are counted toward the combo;
		if anyone hits anything, the combo is continued. You can cooperate with your party members to pull off massive
		combos - and massive damage.
		<br clear="all">
		<br>
		Finally, changing the element of an attack causes the gauge to rise faster (i.e. a sword attack followed by a
		water attack followed by a fire attack.)

		Status Effects
	</div>
	<div class="c_block_body">
		Monsters and traps can sometimes inflict status effects on your party members. Some of your spells and special
		weapons can do likewise to your foes.

					While most attacks can be guarded against, some are so heavy or violent that they cannot be blocked.
					<br>
					While you cannot know for certain if an attack is unblockable until it hits you in the face, it's
					worth keeping the following in mind:
					<br>
					<br>
					・Magic, save for Magical Shots, is unblockable.<br>
					・Full-body tackles from large creatures cannot be blocked, nor can attacks from above like Downstab
					or charging attacks.<br>
					・Attacks from heavy weapons, like warhammers or massive clubs, are often strong enough to break
					through one's guard.<br>
					・Flame breath or gas attacks will go right through any defense.<br>
					<br>
					If an attack is unblockable, the damage number it generates will be larger than normal.
					Against such attacks, you have two options: either dodge out of the way completely... or attack your
					foe before they have a chance to strike.
					<br>
					<br>
					A few enemies may be armed with tower shields and the like, which will let them guard against nearly
					any kind of attack. Sadly, Arche isn't quite big enough to use one herself.
