				<div class="c_block_body">
					When you're in dungeons and stuff, if you don't conserve your magic, you'll totally run out of MP
					really fast! You'll run out even if you have four tens of MP! And that's terrible! You need to tell
					your mage allies to lay off the magic!
					<br><br>
					Of course, if you're up against a big nasty boss monster or something, why hold back?! Have your
					mages go nuts! If your mages hold back, you won't get stuff like support spells, and those can
					really help!

				<div class="c_block_body">
					If you just swing your sword like a crazy person, all you'll manage to do is get beat up! You have
					to guard against or avoid an enemy's attack, then counter! You can turn on Auto-guard if you want
					the game to help you with that,
					and you can use it to learn an enemy's attack pattern before beating them into tar!
					<br><br>
					A lot of enemies will do stuff before they attack, like slimes quivering, so learn to look for that,
					too!

					If you're, like, more than two levels below your current max level? Try leveling up some!

					If you ARE at max level, look for any Marks of Heroism you might've missed.

					I think there's a fortune-teller somewhere who can tell you if you missed any...

				<div class="c_block_body">
					Your experience gain - and how hard you get punched in the face - changes depending on the
					difficulty level you selected. Once you've gotten used to the controls, and if you want to level up
					really fast, you can try increasing the difficulty. If you find a certain boss REALLY hard, you can
					turn it down, too.
					<br><br>
					Oh yeah, and in the prologue, the experience curve isn't very high, so changing difficulties won't
					do much.
