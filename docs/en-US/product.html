			In the full version of Fortune Summoners, great adventures await Arche not only in her home town of
			Tonkiness, but all across southern Scotsholm!
			<br>
			<br>
			The secret of the ancient elemental stone, life-or-death combat against gigantic foes, and a threat which
			threatens the peace of the land!
			<br>
			<br>
			All of this awaits in the 20+ hour adventure in the full version!
			<br>
			We hope to see you there!

		<div class="c_advice">

			In the full version, Stella will (after some cajoling) join the party, filling out your roster, and you'll
			have access to the strongest spells and sword techniques, such as Explosion, Water Blow, and The Full Moon.
			<br><br>
			Of course, the enemy won't hold back either, as your foes will form groups of warriors and mages, driven by
			the same AI which guides your party members!<br><br>
			The strategy behind these encounters is the real fun of Fortune Summoners, and we hope you'll give the full
			version a try!
