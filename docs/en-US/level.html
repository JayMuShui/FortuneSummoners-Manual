		When your party defeats monsters or other foes, all party members present (and on their feet) receive experience
		points. Once you gain enough points, you will gain a level, increasing your attributes and possibly giving you a
		new spell or ability.

		<br>
		Attribute and ability/spell gains will be displayed when you press F1 after a level up.
		<br>
		<br>
		There is, however, a limit to the number of levels you can gain. Should you reach your current level cap (which
		begins at 3), you cannot gain any experience.

		<img class="c_screen" src="./images/level/level_yuuki.jpg" style="margin:4px 24px 4px 0px;" align="left" />
		<br>
		To increase your level cap, you must obtain Marks of Heroism, like the one shown here.
		<br>
		<br>
		The level cap is party-wide; even members not in the party will benefit from Marks gained when they are not in
		the party. Marks also increase the amount of money you can carry.

			A character's total level is determined by a combination of their adventurer level and combat level.
			<BR>
			<br>
			When you collect a Mark of Heroism, your adventurer level increases and your combat level decreases; this
			effectively works as a simple increase in your level cap.
			If, however, you collect a Mark when your combat level is 0, you will gain a character level as combat level
			cannot be reduced any further.
			<br>
			<br>
			In the prologue, Marks only increase combat level as opposed to adventurer level and effectively act as a
			simple level cap expander.
