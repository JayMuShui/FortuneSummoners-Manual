	When the player characters get near monsters, combat with the monsters will begin. AI companions will automatically take up positions and do battle with the enemy as dictated by their AI orders.
	<br>
	<br>
	When you have party members present, you can press ENTER to swap which character you are controlling.

Basic Combat
</div>
<div class="c_block_body">
	Firstly, remember to draw your sword with Z if you are controlling Arche!
	<br>
	The X key will cause a basic attack. Arrow key combinations along with X can trigger powerful special moves, and magicians can hold down the X key to cast powerful spells.
	<br>
	Sword-fighting details can be found under "<a href="battle_sword.htm">Sword Combat</a>",
	and the proper use of magic can be found under "<a href="battle_magic.htm">Mage Combat</a>".

	Enemy attacks can be guarded against (up key), jumped over (C key), or ducked (down key) depending on the situation. Guarding will reduce incoming damage from an attack by half or more.
	<br>
	(If you set a character to auto-guard under the options, they will guard automatically in certain conditions.)

HP Recovery
</div>
<div class="c_block_body">
	<img  class="c_screen" src="./img/battle_heal_damage.jpg" align="left" />
	As you are hit in combat, you will lose HP. Use healing items or spells to ensure your HP does not reach zero, or your characters will not be able to fight!
	<br clear="all">
	<br>
	If you wish to heal quickly, you may press F2 to use a healing item to restore health to the character with the lowest percentage of HP.
	<br>
	<br>
	<img  class="c_screen" src="./img/battle_heal_auto.jpg" align="left" />
	Items used in combat do not take effect immediately; when an item is used, this meter will appear. When it is completely filled, the item will take effect. You may press F2 again while an item is being used to cancel its use.
	<br clear="all">
	<br>
	The F2 quick-item feature can be used to cure status effects like Poison as well. Outside of combat, such items are used instantly. If you wish to select a target to use an item on, select the item from the Item menu, and then the target.
	<br>
	<br>
	<img  class="c_screen" src="./img/battle_heal_magic.jpg" align="left" />
	If you have a spellcaster with a heal with you, they can be set to heal you when your HP reaches a certain level. If you take control of the character directly, you can control when healing goes out yourself.
	<br>
	Advanced magic use is covered under "<a href="battle_magic.htm">Magical Combat</a>".
	<br clear="all">
	<br>
	
	<div class="c_advice_title">Always Carry Healing Items!</div>
	<div class="c_advice">
		While your allies may have healing magic, in the chaos of battle it will not always be practical to use it when you need it. You should always carry healing items with you at all times.
		<br>
		<br>
	</div>
	<br>
	<div class="c_advice_title">Quick-Item Controls</div>
	<div class="c_advice">
		F2 triggers the use of the quick-item feature, but by default the F key does as well. Should you find it difficult to press the F2 key in time, use the F key instead. You may also change this in the Keyboard Setup menu under Options.

<div class="c_title3">
Fleeing From Combat
</div>
<div class="c_block_body">
	<img  class="c_screen" src="./img/battle_escape.jpg" align="left" />
	When enemies are nearby, the "escape meter" will display when you stand next to a door or exit. Pressing up will fill the meter, and when it fills completely you will escape to the next room.
	<br clear="all">
	<img  class="c_screen" src="./img/battle_escape2.jpg" align="left" vspace="4" />
	<br>
	However, you cannot flee to places you have not already been, and you cannot flee from boss fights.
