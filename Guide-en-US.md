# 2. HD & Compatibility Patch (Fix Win10/11 Adaptation Issues)
As this game was released quite some time ago, it may encounter issues such as abnormal fullscreen display, blurry graphics, crashes, or stutters on Windows 10/11. Installing the following patch will effectively resolve these problems:

## Step 1: Download the Patch
Visit the [DDrawCompat Github Releases page](https://github.com/narzoul/DDrawCompat/releases) and download the latest version of the compressed package (prioritize the regular release without the "debug" label; no complex configuration required).

## Step 2: Install the Patch
Extract the downloaded compressed package, locate the `ddraw.dll` file inside, and directly copy it to the game's root directory (the same folder as the game's executable file `sotes.exe`).

### Additional Notes
- This patch is designed to fix compatibility and graphics issues of older games on new systems. No extra settings are needed—just copy the file and launch the game to take effect.
- Tested Validation: Windows 11 Pro for Workstations 25H2 (Build 26200.7462) paired with patch version 0.7.0 (released on December 17, 2025) runs smoothly without any additional configuration.

### Troubleshooting
- If the patch doesn’t work, first check the [DDrawCompat official documentation](https://github.com/narzoul/DDrawCompat/) for solutions.
- Try Compatibility Mode: Right-click `sotes.exe` → Select "Properties" → Switch to the "Compatibility" tab → Check "Run this program in compatibility mode for" → Choose "Windows Vista" or an earlier version. You can also test other compatibility options (e.g., "Reduced color mode") and restart the game after making changes.
- If none of the above methods work, we recommend seeking help from communities like the Steam Community.
